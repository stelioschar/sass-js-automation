sass-js-automation v0.1.1
==================


Dependencies
--------------

You need to have ruby installed and to be added to your windows' PATH variables

Also you need to install sass

```sh
gem install sass
```

The v0.0.1 uses CSS source maps, that's why compass v1.0.0.alpha.19 is needed. To install this version you need to run  

```sh
gem install compass --pre
```

if you don't need to have CSS source maps you can just install the stable version of Compass, but you need to remove the 'sourcemaps' option from your GruntFile into the compass task

```sh
gem install compass
```

Installation
--------------

First you need to download load all the node depend modules using the node package manager(npm)

```sh
npm install
```

Workflow
----
Development:
1. Compile styles scss files using compass also using source maps
2. Autoprefix css file previously generated by compass updating source maps
3. Compile coffeescript files also using source maps

Production - build:
1. Clean production folders
2. Copy needed files (e.g. sprites image file) to production folders
2. Minify & combine css files
3. Minify & combine javascript files

Usage
----

For development process run:

```sh
grunt
```

For production file generation run:

```sh
grunt build
```

Feel free to change: 
- the **.scss** files under the **scss** folder, compiled to **styles/main.css** file
- the **.coffee** files under the **coffeescript** folder, compiled to **scripts/main.js** file
- the **.js** files under the **js** folder, compiled to **scripts/scripts.min.js** file
- add as more **.png** files under your * 'images/sprites/' * folder

NOTES
----
- css files combination & minification cannot be supported during development process since there is no sourcemap support
- in order to keep consistency javascript combination & minification is also completed during launch process (production)
